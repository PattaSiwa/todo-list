Todo-list using JQuery

Made this app because I wanted to get more practice with JQuery. It is not an original App. It is a codealong with a Colt Steele video on youtube(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAs4Ncg0PlY&list=PLa5qVXTT08DVEI0I9hSk5tNkadmTmhUPa&ab_channel=TechSchool_ColtSteele)
It is mostly a learning experience with exploring JQuery and what it can do. I took the liberty of changing some of the features and changed most of the styling.

The app lets the user add items by typing in the input box and hitting the enter key to add an item to the list. User can cross item off by clicking on the task they want get crossed off.
User can also remove the item completely by clicking the icon to the right that pops out as the mouse hovers the task. 
I also added a "How to use" modal to help with the user experience. 

Special Thanks to Colt Steele for putting out great free content on Youtube. 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery
